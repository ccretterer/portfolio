                I&aposm a current senior at Dartmouth College, majoring in Government and Computer Science. 
                As I approach the end of my undergraduate education in November 2024, I&aposm actively seeking 
                new graduate positions where I can make meaningful contributions and further my growth in areas 
                that deeply interest me: technology, cybersecurity, national security, and sustainability.
